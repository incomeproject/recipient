# Recipient Facing Application
## This is the application that allows users to sign up to be a prospective recipient, configure communication preferences, and connect a bank account to receive their monthly UBI payments.
### Users should be able to:
#### Sign in/up:
* [ ] Sign up for an account using an email and password
* [ ] Verify their email address
* [ ] Update their email address
* [ ] Update their password
* [ ] Use their email address to set a new password should they get locked out
* [ ] (stretch) enable/setup 2-factor
#### Contact:
* [ ] Enter their phone number
* [ ] Update their phone number
* [ ] Enter their address
* [ ] Update their address
* [ ] Enter first/last name
* [ ] Update first/last name
* [ ] Consent and withdraw consent to be contacted via email
* [ ] Consent and withdraw consent to be contacted via phone
* [ ] Consent to work with us or collaborating orgs (i.e. academic orgs) to collect data useful for demonstrating the impact of UBI on its recipients
#### Selection:
* [ ] Users should be able to see their selection status ("incomplete" if we don't have all needed data, "awaiting selection" if all needed data is provided, or "receiving UBI" if/when they've been selected and funded.
### Need to be researched:
* [ ] Need a way of verifying individuality (only one valid account per person)
* [ ] Need a way of verifying income/wealth of the user (for the first few batches, it may be sensible to prioritize low-income people to maximize positive impact)
* [ ] Need a way of connecting to a bank account for the UBI payments to be sent to
